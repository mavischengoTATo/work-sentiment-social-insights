									<h1>Introduction<br />

									<p></p>
									<p>In this project, there are two main points I want to explore, how data science help people to do job hunting and the second is people's attitude towards work, which is also the focus of the whole project. I hope to complete this project by collecting the voice of different people about work through social media, which is the main way I collect the data. Besides, I also hope to use exist dataset to deal with the first problem. In detail, there are some specific aspects of this topic.  </p>
                                    <p>After experiencing covid-19, some people feel that the earth is coming to an end and their life will continue to deteriorate, so they choose to be more pessimistic towards work and do nothing. For example, some new graduate students, who have experienced covid-19, are very pessimistic about work and employment situation, so choose to go to graduate universities, gap year or stay at home as "NEET" without looking for a job. There are so many this kind of students around me. This is supported by some data, such as the unprecedented number of people taking the postgraduate entrance examination in China this year. And some people are tired of frequent covid-19 testing and isolation policies, which cause the economic downturn. These lead people to express very pessimistic attitude published on social media, or the increase or decrease in the number of working immigrants in countries with strict epidemic prevention policies. </p>
                                    <p>Some people are more optimistic about life, start to travel, find the value of life, start to cherish health more, which is also an aspect of negative attitude towards work. For example, some people choose to retire early.</p>   
                                    <p>Some people think that the epidemic has brought more job opportunities, because many people are afraid of looking for jobs. Others think that there are fewer people looking for jobs, and the competitive pressure is reduced, so they face work with a positive attitude. In order to reduce the pressure on their children, some parents choose to continue working after retirement, which is also a manifestation of their positive attitude towards work.</p>  
                                    <p>Why is this important? Because people's attitudes guide the government to balance the relationship between controlling the epidemic and developing the economy to control the unemployment rate. Understanding people's attitudes and how the epidemic affects people's attitudes can help society understand how to relieve people's psychological pressure and promote social development.</p>
                                    <p>First of all, work is a very life-oriented topic, and it is also a topic that people can hardly escape. In this society, everyone needs to work to support their family. It is precisely because everyone performs his or her own duties that this society operates smoothly. People have been working for 30 or 40 years, which accounts for more than half of their life span, from the time they step out of the school gate to retirement at the age of 50 or 60. Work has been accompanied by people from just stepping out of school to getting married and having children. People have been planning for work for a long time. When entering college from high school, one thing people often consider is whether the major I choose is easy to find a job. When choosing a major, people often focus on the salary. </p>
                                    <p>So, the first question we want to explore is: 1. what the relationship between working years, working departments and job titles and hourly pay. </p>
                                    <p>The second question is: 2. what the relationship between these and regular pay. </p>
									<p>With this connection, we can better understand which types of jobs are highly paid, which is helpful for us to choose a major or a career.</p>
									<p>From university to society, fresh graduates are struggling to find jobs. So, one question we want to know is about job hunting, that is, how to quickly obtain important information from recruitment information. People often learn recruitment information from recruitment websites and send resumes. Imagine that you are now a data science graduate who wants to deliver a resume. When browsing various recruitment information, which part of the recruitment information is the most important? Wages? Position? Where? Everyone has his own primary concern. But according to our intuition, the first thing is that we need to see whether our skills and experience match the job description. Secondly, there is another issue that we are very concerned about: wages. However, we often encounter some difficulties. The salary column in the recruitment information is often undisclosed. It may be that the company that releases information wants to talk about salary or confidential salary to prevent disclosure, but this is very annoying for interviewers. You need to talk with HR or interview to get relevant information in a time-consuming way, and time is not always precious when looking for a job. </p>
									<p>So, the first question here we want to study is: 3. whether we can judge whether the job is high paid or low paid from the job description.</p>
									<p>The second question here is: 4. whether we can judge the position level of the job from the job description. </p>
									<p>We hope to study this problem because the position title is expressed differently in each company, but it must be related to the salary level in general, which can also help us judge what title such job description should be in the industry.</p>
									<p>Work can be a choice for new graduates and can also be a choice for people after retirement. Thus, people's attitudes on work can be reflected by people's attitudes towards some words closely related to work, such as job hunting, work, retirement and new graduates. And this is also a way to explore people's attitude towards work through crowd classification, whether it is positive or negative. So, we also need to do emotional analysis on the data collected from Twitter. And we also hope to see whether people will agree or disagree with the work comments from the tweets collected from Twitter, that is, to study these comments through whether people like them and whether they forward them. These are some of the problems that we will face later. namely:</p>
									<p>5. What tweets about work will be favorited by people?</p>
									<p>6. What tweets about work will be retweeted by people?</p>
									<p>7. What are people's emotional attitudes towards tweets about work?</p>
									<p>8. What are people's emotional attitudes towards tweets about job hunting?</p>
									<p>9. For new graduates, what are people's emotional attitudes towards work?</p>
									<p>10. For retirees, what is their emotional attitude towards work?</p>
									<p>Through these ten questions, we hope to have an understanding of people's attitudes towards work divided by people, and we also hope that we can give you some suggestions in the selection of work occupations and the analysis of job information through the method of data science.</p>
