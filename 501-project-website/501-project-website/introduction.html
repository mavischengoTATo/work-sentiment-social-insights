									<h1>Introduction<br />

									<p>In this project, what I want to figure out is the impact of covid-19 on people's attitudes towards work. In detail, there are some specific aspects of this topic. </p>
                                    <p>First, let's talk about work. Work can be a choice for new graduates and can also be a choice for people after retirement. Thus, people's attitudes on work can be reflected by people's attitudes towards the substitute of work, as go to a school of a higher grade for new graducate or entertainment for retiree.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>After experiencing covid-19, some people feel that the earth is coming to an end and their life will continue to deteriorate, so they choose to be more pessimistic towards work and do nothing. For example, some new graduate students, who have experienced covid-19, are very pessimistic about work and employment situation, so choose to go to graduate universities, gap year or stay at home as "NEET" without looking for a job. There are so many this kind of students around me. This is supported by some data, such as the unprecedented number of people taking the postgraduate entrance examination in China this year. And some people are tired of frequent covid-19 testing and isolation policies, which cause the economic downturn.  These lead people to express very pessimistic attitude published on social media, or the increase or decrease in the number of working immigrants in countries with strict epidemic prevention policies . 
                                    </p>   
                                    <p>   Some people are more optimistic about life, start to travel, find the value of life, start to cherish health more, which is also an aspect of negative attitude towards work. For example, some people choose to retire early.
                                    </p>  
                                    <p>
                                        Some people think that the epidemic has brought more job opportunities, because many people are afraid of looking for jobs. Others think that there are fewer people looking for jobs, and the competitive pressure is reduced, so they face work with a positive attitude. In order to reduce the pressure on their children, some parents choose to continue working after retirement, which is also a manifestation of their positive attitude towards work
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Why is this important? Because people's attitudes guide the government to balance the relationship between controlling the epidemic and developing the economy to control the unemployment rate. Understanding people's attitudes and how the epidemic affects people's attitudes can help society understand how to relieve people's psychological pressure and promote social development.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> It can be divided into serveral questions.</p>
                                    <p> 1.What is the relationship between people's attitude towards work and age?</p>
                                    <p> 2.Whether people's attitudes towards work are generally positive or negative on social media?</p>
                                    <p> 3.Are new graduates choosing to continue their studies in order to avoid work? </p>
                                    <p> 4.Whether the epidemic affects young people's attitude towards work more or the elderly more?</p>
                                    <p> 5.What is the relationship between people's attitude towards work and gender?</p>
                                    <p> 6.What is the relationship between people's attitude towards work and country?</p>
                                    <p> 7.What is the relationship between people's attitude towards work on social media and actual unemployment rateï¼Ÿ </p>
                                    <p> 8.What is the relationship between people's attitude towards work on social media and box office</p>
                                    <p> 9.What is the relationship between people's attitude towards work on social media and salary?</p>
                                    <p> 10.What keywords about work attitude on social media can predict the future unemployment rate?</p>
