									<h3>Self introduction</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>Hi, everyone!  My name is Zijing Cheng and you can call me Mavis.  I am a Chinese, and my Chinese name means that a lady is talented and virtuous, which is my parents' good expectation for me. Another interesting thing about my name is that when you read my Chinese name in the order of English names, my name sounds just like the pronunciation of the Forbidden City in Chinese. </p>
									<p> I graduated from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in Shenzhen, majoring in finance. When I was in college, I actively participated in many clubs on campus, including the management in the Shimmer welfare organization, the Icraft Club, the bionature Biology Club and the Alto of the campus chorus. In these clubs, I have made many friends with common interests, and organized and participated in a variety of on campus and off campus activities. One of the things I still remember deeply is that I went to rural middle schools to teach as a volunteer. This experience impressed me deeply. Later, I wrote a research report on the future career vision of rural children with several classmates. That was the first time I had an experience of writing a research report completely and a rough understanding of the data analysis cooperating with my classmates. At that time, we collected questionnaires from children and teenagers in the school to ask them about their future career vision and their family situation and personal information. Through statistical analysis of the questionnaire data, we have a knowledge of the future career vision of rural children, so as to find some helpful ways for their future career planning. We provided the report and suggestions to the teachers of the school, and we checked the relevant policies, and found that our conclusions are also somewhat similar to the new national policies. Such exploration experience made me yearn for data analysis, and let me know that we can make the world a little better through our own efforts and analysis.</p>
									<p> Besides, during my undergraduate years, I did many projects in financial technology, quantitative finance and machine learning in the business field. These projects make me very interested in work involving machine learning, financial technology and other fields. In these projects, I really enjoyed creating problems, analyzing problems and solving problems from unorganized data. This process gives me a sense of achievement. In the process of discussing with my classmates, we improved our research ability and learned from each other's strengths to make common progress. In the process of data research, I have a more intuitive and profound understanding of the operation rules of the financial world, and the numerous and massive financial data also exercise my ability to process data analysis. These experiences formed me, which made me have great enthusiasm for the future work related to data.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="" /></span> In the future, I really interested in becoming a data analyst in tech or financial companies, which is my dream job as this is full of both opportunities and challenges. I have always held the view that we should constantly tap our potential in opportunities and challenges so that we can take a longer and more successful path in life. My previous internship experience in a technology company mainly engaged in ride-hailing services made me feel the fun and sense of achievement of my work, and also made me have a career goal to continue to work in a technology company in data related work. Just like working on a project in my university, a group of people gather together to solve the problems raised by one business department, also to monitor and explore the possible problems hidden in the company's business. Through a variety of visualizations and presentations, the pale code can be vividly displayed to colleagues without knowledge of data analysis in a more straightforward and simple way, so that they can focus on problems, solve problems and avoid risks. One of the most impressive is the project of forecasting the company's annual GMV. In this project, we need to collect all kinds of data to evaluate the work efficiency of each department and market share of the company business. I was surprised that the leaders proposed to use a lot of alternative data, which is not directly related to the company's income, to predict the company's GMV. Including the use of time series analysis to process the growth rate of GMV and natural language processing to collect and process passenger reviews to obtain useful information, I learned a lot of useful working skills. These experiences make me hope that I can continue to make in-depth research in the field of data science rather than limited to financial related data.</p>
									<p> In this program, I hope to learn more methods of understanding data and analyzing data, especially in machine learning, learn data science more systematically, and tap my ability to apply what I have learned to actual business models.  Besides, I hope to get a more complete and systematic study of data science. In my previous studies, more practical knowledge is first, that is, when I know what statistical knowledge and model knowledge need to be used in my projects, I will go to specialized study and learn these aspects of knowledge, but there is no complete framework. In the postgraduate study, what I want more is to build a complete data science framework first, and then I add the knowledge I learned to this framework. I believe this is a truly more efficient way of learning.</p>
									<p> As for hobbies, I have a lot of hobbies. I like cooking, fitness, weightlifting, watch TV shows, handcraft, hiking and traveling very much, and one of my unique hobbies is collecting dolls, especially dolls of Jellycat and Disney. If you have the same hobbies, we can communicate with each other and become friends. I'm very happy that we can go to the gym together or have dinner together on festivals.</p>
